# How to run the program:
1. Navigate to the root directory of the project in a terminal that supports Python (eg. GitBash, PowerShell, etc)
2. Run the `main.py` file by executing `python main.py`
3. To change which input file is read for the data sets, open the `main.py` file and modify the `training_set` and/or `testing_set` variables on lines 40/41 respectively.
4. To view the outputs files, wait until the application has completed running, and navigate to the `/outputs` directory.
